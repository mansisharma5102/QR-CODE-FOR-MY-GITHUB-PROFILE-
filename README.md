Import Libraries:

The code begins by including necessary libraries that provide functionalities for generating QR codes and handling image operations.
Create QR Code Object:

A QR code object is created with specific configurations that determine its properties, such as size, error correction capability, and appearance.
Add Data:

The desired data, in this case, a URL, is incorporated into the QR code. This data is what the QR code will represent when scanned.
Generate the QR Code:

The QR code is constructed based on the provided data. The dimensions of the QR code are adjusted to ensure it can accommodate the specified information.
Create Image:

An image representation of the generated QR code is created. The colors for the QR code and its background are specified during this process.
Save the Image:

The QR code image is saved to a file in a specified format. This allows it to be easily shared or used later.
Display the Image:

Finally, the generated QR code image is opened in a default viewer, allowing the user to see and interact with it immediately.
Overall, this process effectively creates a customized QR code containing a specific URL, saves it as an image file, and displays it for user access.
